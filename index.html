        <h1>Hi, this is Dawna</h1>
        <p>I am a creative User Experience Designer with a multidisciplinary 
          background in sales, fitness, and fine art.  
          <br>My previous experience in other fields allow me focus on the 
          human-centered design approach as I tackle challenging 
          problems, crafting solutions that benefit both stakeholders and 
          users.</p>
          <p>Originally born in Seattle, I was raised between China and Hong Kong, 
          now living in Chicago. Growing up learning to speak three languages not
           only made me an excellent communicator but also made me hyper aware of otherâ€™s perspectives. 
           In my work I am accustomed to asking others for feedback throughout a project to 
           prioritize the needs and wants of the client I am serving.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Outside of work I enjoy painting, baking pretty cookies 
           and replicating recipes from some of my favorite restaurants form Chicago! 
           I also practice various forms of martial arts- boxing is my current focus and my 
           favorite combo is 1-2-3-3-2 :) </p>
           <p>You can reach me on LinkedIn or via dawnachung@gmail.com <br>
